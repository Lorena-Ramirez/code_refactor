# Horiseon
This website is a SEO company representing search engine optimization.

**Additions**
* Within the project I fixed the navigation link 'search engine optimization' so that it correctly navigates to the corresponding area on the webpage.
* The html has been altered slightly to ensure descriptions are provided for each picture in order to better the overall accesabilityof the webpage.
* Semantic HTML elements have also been added in order to improve readability and flow of the code.
* Within the html class names were changed in order to be more inclusive of multiple sections this allowed the CSS file to be consolidated and more organized.
